## Introduction

Understanding how populations evolve is essential for governments, development agencies, and researchers working on long-term planning. I analyzed global population data spanning 1990 to 2024, focusing on country-level changes, regional contributions, and long-term growth trends.

The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into global population trends using data from multiple countries spanning 34 years. The analysis focuses on key demographic indicators such as total population, growth rates, and how these differ by region. It is designed to support decision-making for policymakers, development practitioners, researchers, and other stakeholders interested in demographic trends.

This analysis answers several demographic questions, including:
- What is the distribution of global population by region in 2024?
- Which regions and countries experienced the highest population growth between 1990 and 2024?
- How do average annual growth rates compare across regions?
- Which countries show evidence of population decline?
- What share of global population does each region hold in 2024?

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis contains **population figures for countries from 1990 to 2024**, including:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Country Name` | Name of the country |
| `Country Code` | ISO country code |
| `Region` | Region classification (e.g., Africa, Asia, Europe) |
| `Population 1990–2024` | Annual population figures |
| `Growth Rate (%)` | Percentage change in population between 1990 and 2024 |
| `Avg Annual Growth Rate (%)` | Compound average annual growth rate (% per year) |

This dataset was processed and transformed using Excel, adding region classifications and calculated growth metrics to facilitate analysis.

## Tools & Techniques Used

Analysis was conducted using **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging:
- PivotTables for regional summaries  
- Formulas to calculate growth rates  
- Conditional formatting for trend identification  
- Charts to visualize population shares and growth

### Regional Population Distribution (2024)
- **Asia** remains the dominant region with over **4.77 billion people**, representing ~**59% of the world’s population**.  
- **Africa** is the **second most populated region**, with ~**1.51 billion people**.  
- Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania follow, with progressively smaller shares.

### Growth Patterns by Region
| Region | Avg Annual Growth Rate (%) |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| Africa | 2.40 |
| Asia | 1.86 |
| South America | 1.14 |
| North America | 1.07 |
| Oceania | 0.96 |
| Europe | 0.21 |

Africa exhibits the strongest growth, indicating demographic momentum, while Europe shows near-stagnant growth. These patterns have significant implications for labor markets, social services, and long-term planning.

### Country-Level Growth Highlights
#### Fastest Growing (1990–2024)
- **Qatar:** +549.25%  
- **UAE:** +473.01%  
- **Equatorial Guinea:** +299.03%  
- **Turks and Caicos:** +298.14%  
- **Afghanistan:** +254.05%

These exceptionally high growth rates often reflect economic migration, natural population increases, or unique demographic forces.

#### Population Decline
- **Latvia:** –30.07%  
- **Bosnia & Herzegovina:** –28.87%  
- **Ukraine:** –27.27%  
- **Bulgaria:** –26.08%  
- **Georgia:** –23.49%

Some declines are linked to migration and aging populations, while others may be influenced by social or political disruptions.

## Recommendations for Stakeholders

### Policy Makers
- **Africa:** Invest in education, healthcare, and employment programs to harness the demographic dividend.
- **Europe:** Address aging populations through supportive immigration and family policies.
- **Asia:** Balance urbanization pressures with sustainable infrastructure investments.

### Development Agencies
- Target resources in regions with rapid growth for education, nutrition, and public health programs.
- Use demographic trends to forecast financial and resource allocation needs.

### Researchers & Businesses
- Population trends can inform market size forecasts, labor supply projections, and regional investment decisions.

## Conclusion

The period from 1990 to 2024 paints a world undergoing significant demographic shifts. Population surges in Africa and parts of Asia contrast sharply with stagnation or decline in Europe and selected post-Soviet states. These transitions carry profound implications for future development, labor markets, geopolitical influence, and global resource planning.
